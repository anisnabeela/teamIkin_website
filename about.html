            <h3>Honest & Efficient Work</h3>

            <p>The name of the GOLD SQUARE RECORD CENTER is adapted from the shape of this record center itself while gold is based on the color of this building and the value of the record we receive and keep it as gold.</p>
				
			<p>Gold Square Record Center is a departmental record center that was established on 1st July 2018 and started operating on 1st July 2019 is one of the initiatives to enhance and assist the management of the records more concise and systematically. Gold Square Record Center is a centralized record center, locally-owned and operated at Krubong Industrial Area, is a full-service archiving facility specializing in the storage and management of paper records and other media for a wide range of businesses. “Streamline office efficiency and increase valuable time while saving money when you use our records management services.”</p>
				
			<p>Since our goal is to provide full-service archiving facility specializing in the storage and management of paper records and other media for a wide range of businesses, Perbadanan Melaka Holdings or known as PMH is the company we choose for. Since the past observation, we found out that PMH doesn't has their own record center and their records are not managed in a proper way as it should, we take this opportunity to approach and serve this company as their record center.</p>
